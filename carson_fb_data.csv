"4","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Our country faces grave national security threats. We must act boldly and decisively to protect American citizens from terrorists at home and abroad. ISIS continues to persecute Christians, enslave young girls, oppress civil societies and perpetrate terrorist attacks against the free world. We must destroy their caliphate and prevent their terrorists from infiltrating our homeland. We must also secure our borders, identify radical Islamic extremism by name and root out its agents and collaborators in our own country. My ""Seven Steps for a Safer America"" offers a path forward for confronting these threats and protecting this great country.

1. Congress should immediately issue a formal declaration of war on the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIL or ISIS.

2. The United States should lead the immediate formation of – and provide substantial advisory, financial and military support to – a military coalition in the Middle East to wage war against ISIS. Such a regional coalition would consist of countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.

3. The United States should urge its allies and partners in the Middle East to engage in massive recruitment and training of Sunni Syrian men based in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf and of Sunni Syrian male refugees in Jordan – to establish a military force to destroy ISIS and to establish a protection zone for the victims of the terrorist state.

4. The United States should deploy its military resources and work with moderate Arab nations – as well as extend strategic support to Kurdish, Christian and Sunni tribes in the free al-Hasakah Province in northeast Syria – to establish a refugee safe zone in the Province. All refugees should be directed to that free area and to other liberated areas later, and be put under international protection.

5. Congress should immediately establish a war-time emergency visa and immigration policy; establish an emergency inter-agency task force to review all visa and immigration policies; and limit visitor visas to three months with mandatory check-ins for extensions no longer than three months.

6. President Barack Obama and Congress should immediately deploy the National Guard and military troops to patrol the U.S. southern border as well as designated spots along the northern border.

7. The Department of State should designate the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations that propagate or support Islamic terrorism as terrorist organizations, and fully investigate the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and a supporter of terrorism.",2016-01-02 19:47:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_575294235970380",NA,23894,644,3858,NA,NA,NA

"43","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","President Obama plans to discuss his latest executive actions on gun control at a town hall tonight. The American people are sick and tired of his grandiose actions that abuse presidential authority, do nothing to solve the actual problems facing our nation, and only hurt law-abiding citizens. We have a Constitutional right in this country to keep and bear arms. Yet President Obama and his Democrat allies like Hillary Clinton continue to propose regulations and restrictions that will only keep guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.

This is political theater at its worst.

Americans are rightly concerned when the same man who promised that you could keep your health care now promises that you can keep your guns. We should have a lively debate in this country about how Congress can keep guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. But the President’s pandering assertions of power are counterproductive.

I wanted to speak briefly about President Obama’s town hall this evening. To be clear and concise: how does his executive action prevent gun violence? Furthermore, to insinuate law-abiding gun owners do not “care” about gun violence is not only inaccurate, it is a demeaning mischaracterization and offensive.

Instead of being concerned about more firearms in the hands of individuals, who want to exercise their Constitutional right to bear arms in defense of life and liberty, perhaps we should address the evident decline in morality in our society that leads to violence.

A society that does not value life is a culture that will perpetuate death – we are one nation, under God, a body that is intended to function in unison, not against its own members. We are suffering at our own hands, dying a death by the thousands every time we focus on superficial political agendas and rhetoric rather than responsibility and relationship. The health of our great nation is dependent on our ability to focus on root causes instead of symptoms.

America is the country I love, the land you and I admire due to the countless number of families that wake up every day looking for the next opportunity to heal, inspire and revive, saying “we can do this” – and, I know We are the People who “will do this” every day into the future.

School Choice:
I will actively support school choice programs, such as school vouchers and charter schools, so every student has the opportunity to fully realize his or her God-given potential.

Empower Parents, Teachers, Local School Districts and the States – Not Washington:
In education, as in so many endeavors, the best decisions are the ones made by those closest to the issue. I will work to directly support students, cut red tape and reduce the size and authority of the Washington educational bureaucracy.

Encourage Innovation:
Everywhere I travel, I am inspired by the creativity of educators whose ideas offer real promise for tomorrow’s students. Rather than micromanaging these educational innovators with onesize- fits-all regulations that suppress their ingenuity, we should promote innovative ideas in education.

Reward Good Teachers:
It is long past the time to give teachers the respect and the resources they deserve. Instead of an outdated system that rewards teacher tenure over performance, I will advocate for flexible block grants to the states to advance and reward teacher quality, and to develop teacher evaluation systems that focus on effectiveness in advancing student achievement.

A Simpler, Streamlined Student Loan Process:
The Department of Education needs to get out of the lending business. We need a simpler, more streamlined and transparent financial aid process that gives students and their families the kind of simple, reliable information they need to make good decisions.",2016-01-08 18:45:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_577716539061483",NA,11292,353,2266,NA,NA,NA

There are hundreds of stories that need to be told of the bravery and sacrifices of our troops and I will do my best to share them with you all.

""Staff Sgt. Matthew McClintock, of Des Moines, Wash., joined the Army in 2006 and served as a Special Forces engineer sergeant, the Washington National Guard said in a statement. McClintock deployed to Iraq in 2007 before being selected by the U.S. Army Special Forces School in May 2009, according to Army Times. He previously deployed to Afghanistan between August 2012 and May 2013 and left active duty for the guard in December 2014.
His most recent deployment to Afghanistan, which began in July, was with the Washington Army National Guard’s Company A, 1/19th Special Forces Group and began in July, the Guard said. 

McClintock was killed by small-arms fire Tuesday during an hourslong battle in the Marjah district of Helmand province. Two other American troops and four Afghan soldiers were injured, military officials said. The coalition conducted 12 airstrikes in the area with a variety of aircraft, including F-16 fighter jets and an AC-130 gunship, said Col. Michael Lawhorn, spokesman for Resolute Support, the military coalition’s operation in Afghanistan.""

It is amazing to see your thoughts and questions on a daily basis, keep sending them to me by texting ASKBEN (the number is 275-236 on your mobile device’s keypad).

Today, I read so many of your comments about my newly-released Education Plan, “Prescription for Achievement” – as many of you pointed out, it is certainly focused on creating opportunities for our next generation by encouraging innovation, unleashing American ingenuity that makes our country distinctively exceptional. 

We should empower our creative educators, fostering an environment rich in developing students’ God-given talents and abilities. The mind of an eager student should not be tamed or hindered by bureaucracy, rather, allowed to climb beyond even what they know to be possible. It is amazing to see the curiosity of our young people develop into the leaders of tomorrow when we allow them to explore – once perceived mountains no longer are seen as impediments, but rather a new challenge ready to be conquered. 

Let’s make clear the path, remove the obstacles of burdensome governmental policies. When families are given the option of school choice programs, students have the opportunity to fully realize their potential and We the People are made stronger by bright minds shining even brighter.

America is the land of opportunity, for all. That is what makes me so proud to walk with you all, ready and resolute to lead with all of you – We the People will restore America because we are all students, learning from one another as we work together to Heal, Inspire and Revive our great nation.

"71","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s that time of night again. I hope everyone had a great weekend. It’s been great as we’ve been able to stay connected as you send me your thoughts via text messages. Keep them coming! Remember to text your questions and thoughts to ASKBEN (the number 275-236 on your mobile device).

The first question, from Amber, commenting about ISIS asks about “how can we even feel safe in our country anymore?”

Amber, I understand, but we must not let fear rule our life – in the midst of chaos, He is always in control. It is our responsibility to respond to His call though, as we become stronger, together, defending America. Far too many brave men and women have and continue to place their lives in harm’s way so that we may enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is time we started recognizing priorities: people instead of political correctness. It is not enough to talk about problems, we must decisively act. 

You must call the enemy out by name. It is impossible to defeat ISIS if we are not willing to call evil what it is and act against it. The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. Now is the time to do something good – not for political points – but for the sake of millions throughout the world. It is time to issue a formal declaration of war on the Islamic State, ISIS. 

It must not stop there – no more imaginary red lines that don’t get enforced. It’s our response that is important – talk softly, but carry a big stick.

Again, always remember that fear is not the response, it is standing firm and resolute. I am ready and I know you are as well. We are in this together.

Next, Tim asks a very straight-forward question “why are you running for President?” He mentioned how “grimy” politics can be and why I would want to do it.

Well Tim, the truth of the matter is I was ready to retire, but I’ve always felt my life was one best spent in service. My professional life was spent in the operating room, healing children when the world told their parents there wasn’t any hope. I spent many hours working on complex cases, impossible odds, only to find my hands weren’t my own instruments. He is the healer and He is the hope.

We all have a calling, serving others with our God-given talents and abilities. Nothing is too small for God to use. My calling just so happened to be in the operating room, yours may be at the local high school, or grocery store – it might even be as an elected official. No matter the role though, we are all called to serve, to give hope and healing to those around us. I am running for President not because of position, but rather a great deal of time in prayer. Our nation has become so divided, polarized by rhetoric, a community bombarded by messages of despair – I am tired of hearing “your current situation determines your future”. Where is the hope? I’m not talking about empty words but real action, authentic engagement that gives rise to a generation of spirited entrepreneurs and explorers. We are a nation full of extraordinary talent, we always have been – our greatest commodity is innovation and inspiration. The world should look at this Great Experiment we call home as that beacon of opportunity – we will restore our standing in the world using the ingenuity that is so distinctively American.

I am running for President to lead We the People with you – we will restore our great nation once more.

Finally, on a lighter note, a young girl named Emily asks “is your new coat keeping you warm in Iowa?” She sent me a picture of her new coat she got for Christmas and noticed the picture I put up on Facebook a couple days ago – in case you haven’t seen it, my son Ben Jr. ran out to a local store when he realized my winter coat wasn’t packed. He’s a great man and takes after his mother.

Yes, Emily, the coat has kept me warm in Iowa and it’s a good thing I had one – it’s pretty cold there right now. It’s been great to see everyone at our Town Halls, and I’m glad they have their coats too, as the lines go out the door. Thanks for asking if I’m staying warm, I’m sure you are with that new coat of yours – tell your parents they did a great job. Maybe you can send me a picture of you building a snowman or some snow angels.

Thank you again for spending the evening with me, I always look forward to our chats.

Goodnight,
Ben",2016-01-11 03:22:21,"status",NA,"138691142964027_578741705625633",NA,9154,425,1566,NA,NA,NA

"79","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Today, I am proud to introduce my foreign policy plan which will restore the United States' role as the world's preeminent leader. The single, most important task of the U.S. government is to keep Americans safe. The Obama administration has failed at confronting the grave threats to our national security and has been content to “lead from behind.” This cannot continue. A Carson administration will lead from the front, promote peace and prosperity through the power of We the People, and restore America’s role as the world’s preeminent leader by enforcing six key principles.

Read my full plan here: crsn.co/CarsonForeignPolicy",2016-01-12 14:31:41,"video","https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/videos/579370018896135/","138691142964027_579370018896135",NA,29030,818,6925,"facebook.com",NA,NA
"80","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","My foreign policy plan revolves around these six key principles which will restore America’s role as the world’s preeminent leader.

1. Rearming the U.S. Military:
America’s national security begins with its military, but draconian budget cuts by the Obama administration have endangered our military supremacy. Our armed forces are too small, too old, out-gunned and under-resourced. A Carson administration will ensure that our military is equipped and authorized to defeat global terrorism, able to deter and respond to regional threats from rogue nations and tyrants, and prepared for other grave contingencies around the world.

2. Revitalizing Critical Alliances:
With the best military in the world, the Carson administration will reinvigorate America’s global alliances and build new partnerships with any country willing to cooperate in pursuit of peace, stability and freedom. Under a Carson administration, no one will question America’s commitment to any ally, especially Israel. As president, I will also re-solidify ties with members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as well as with other friends and allies around the world.

3. Restoring U.S. Global Leadership:
For peace to prevail, America must resume its role as global leader, deterring and defeating aggression where necessary. As president, I will seek to destroy the Islamic State; withdraw from the unfortunate Iran nuclear agreement engineered by the Obama-Clinton administration; punish Russia for its naked land grabs; and seek opportunities for cooperation with China while holding Beijing accountable for any violations of international norms.

4. Renewing the National Security Establishment:
As we rearm and resume our leadership role in the world, we must also reform the national security establishment. As president, I cannot ask the American people to pay for a military build-up without demanding corresponding efficiencies. That includes streamlining agencies, making our defense procurement more responsive to strategic requirements and reforming vast government bureaucracies.

5. Re-Evaluating When to Put American Troops in Harm's Way:
There is no more solemn duty for the President of the United States than the execution of his responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief. I will only place America’s armed forces in harm’s way when necessary to protect America and her allies. Every deployment will begin with a clear vision, a strategy to achieve victory and the necessary resources to succeed.

6. Reviving Economic Prosperity:
A sound foreign policy approach requires a similarly sound economic plan, and our ability to mount and sustain viable responses to global threats is undergirded by our economic strength. Unfortunately, years of fiscal irresponsibility are threatening to put limitations on our defense capabilities. As president, I will curtail overreaching government and galvanize entrepreneurial endeavors, put the United States on the glide path to a balanced budget and bolster our ability to project power and lead the world.",2016-01-12 16:45:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_579400782226392",NA,12765,379,3195,NA,NA,NA

"86","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","My response to President Obama's State of the Union address:

President Obama took a victory lap tonight even though he has little to celebrate. The failures of the past seven years are apparent to ordinary Americans across the country, but the President continues to engage in denial and self-congratulation.
 
The President says that “anyone claiming America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.” In reality, anyone claiming a rosy picture of economy recovery is peddling fiction.

Nearly eight years after the Great Recession, some 14% of Americans remain underemployed in the Obama economy.

Our labor participation rate is at its lowest point in 40 years, and nearly 40% of Americans are not even looking for work.

The President says focusing on the threat of the Islamic State is over the top; yet, the savagery of terrorism as exhibited from Umpqua Community College in Oregon to Chattanooga to Paris tells us that the only thing over the top is Obama’s nonchalant disposition regarding the threat of radical Islamic extremism. While he lectures Americans about strengthening our defenses against homegrown terrorism, he cannot even identify the threat of Islamic extremism by name.

The President says that if Congress is serious about winning the war against the Islamic State, it needs to authorize the use of military force against the terrorists. In reality, if the President is serious about winning this war, he needs to come up with a strategy for defeating and destroying the Islamic State. Thus far, he has only come up with empty promises and movable redlines.

The President talks about helping Ukraine defend its democracy. Yet, he has repeatedly refused to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression.

Unfortunately, after seven years, the only countries with which the United States has improved relations are Iran and Cuba. By contrast, I have a foreign policy plan for restoring America’s global leadership in the world.

The President assures us that America’s military isn’t losing its global strength. In reality, thanks to draconian defense cuts imposed by the Obama administration, our armed forces are currently too small, too old, outgunned and under-resourced. Additionally, no one is calling the United States for global leadership right now – the world has seen seven years of a President unwilling to take a stand, and willing to unilaterally disarm the world's greatest military. 

The President talks about protecting Medicare. In fact, Obamacare has done vast damage to our entire health care system. I have a plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare that is centered on expanding choice, creating health empowerment accounts for every citizen and restoration of the doctor-patient relationship.
The President asks how we can give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy. His solution has been to crush entrepreneurs, small businesses and middle-class families with vast regulations and higher taxes.

I have a different solution: a flat tax of 14.9% applied to income—only once. I know something about having a long shot to success, and I know that shared prosperity in this country will materialize when the government gets out of the way of the talents and ingenuity of the American people.

The President takes credit for the energy revolution that has drastically cut our oil imports. In reality, he can take zero credit for the country’s fracking boom. His achievement has been funneling money to special interests and political cronyism, and failed government funded ventures such as Solyndra.

The President ended his speech by saying he is as confident as he’s ever been about the state of the union. Unfortunately, voters across the country do not share that enthusiasm. In their opinion, the state of the union is not strong.",2016-01-13 04:55:14,"status",NA,"138691142964027_579672525532551",NA,84246,3185,24762,NA,NA,NA

"112","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Dr. Ben Carson was the clear winner of tonight’s debate. He showed that unlike the current administration, he will take decisive action defending America and destroying ISIS. 

Also, unlike the current administration, he will call out our enemies, such as the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), ignoring the criticism of liberals and the PC police. CAIR hides under the thin veil of advocacy, when in reality they are funding terrorists who want to destroy us. Dr. Carson has called for a full and complete investigation of CAIR.

Tonight Dr. Carson showed America that he has the resolve and the plan to defeat ISIS. He will keep ISIS on the run, leaving them nowhere to hide and no means to plan attacks on the US and our allies.

Dr. Carson did not resort to wisecracks. He displayed the wisdom of a citizen-statesman, not a political showman. 

Dr. Carson offered prescriptive empathy for the anger and frustration of the American people. He is the candidate who will unify us, who displayed wisdom and offered common sense solutions to the problems we face.

"138","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","In 1964, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. accepted the Nobel Peace prize, he said, ‘I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.’  After fifty years of liberals making promises and the last seven years of false hope from President Obama, not much has changed.  African Americans are still fighting for space on the bottom rung of the economic ladder.
 
The high poverty rate in the black community continues because the very tools that should be used to promote economic opportunity instead keep low income and minority communities in chains. 
 
We have a school reform movement that continues to penalize low income and minority students by keeping them trapped in failing schools rather than giving them the choice to attend schools that best suit their academic needs.  We have a school reform movement that rewards national teacher’s unions at the expense of what is best for our students.
 
My education plan, provides school choice to families, empowers local communities, encourages the innovative spirit of educators, rewards good teachers and creates a streamlined student loan process.  Politicians have not had the resolve to make these essential changes, but I am not a politician. 

We are kidding ourselves if we believe that an education system that takes power away from parents and gives it to bureaucrats in Washington will improve lives and bridge the education gap.  It will not.  I am proof positive of what happens when parents have the power to make the right decisions for their children.  Through God’s grace and my mother’s wisdom, my brother and I were able to escape poverty.
 
I know that education is the great liberator.  And if we do not make significant changes to our education system, in the years ahead when we celebrate Dr. King’s legacy, minority communities will still lag behind.",2016-01-18 18:44:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_582217635278040",NA,18844,618,4572,NA,NA,NA

"144","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, I hope everyone had a great day celebrating the life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. today. I had a great time answering your questions during the live town hall on Facebook. Keep sending me your questions by texting them to the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).

First, Sarah asks “what is your strategy to bring unity to such a frustrated and anger driven society?” She mentions how there are those, specifically in elected office, who are very divisive, looking to only drive wedges between us rather than talking about what makes us whole.

Sarah, thank you for bringing this up, it is a discussion that politicians give ‘tip toe’ answers to – luckily, I am not a politician.

I don’t know about you, but I am tired of hearing what is wrong with “this group” or “that group”, and what we are ‘against’ – I would rather talk about what we are for! Differences make us unique, individually gifted with certain skills and abilities that make one link a strong chain – what is not unique, however, is the history of societies and cultures that use their differences against themselves, their own people. All great nations have been brought down from within through political rhetoric, creating enmity and alienation among the people – when we allow ourselves to look at each other as enemies, the real culprit stands behind the curtain pulling our strings with a smile. I’m focused on unifying principles and common ideals – even if we disagree, it’s always important to have an open and honest dialogue, not a shouting match trying to pervert reality. 

A war on women, a war on poverty, race wars, class wars…enough with these fictitious wars.

My strategy is listening to We the People instead of I the Politician – we have a vested interest in each other because we aren’t looking to say what is politically correct. It’s time to get back to common sense solutions that empower individuals to explore their potential, we’ve all had enough of elected officials pitting us against each other, only to find we are in a worse condition than before. Enough kicking the can down the road, only to find We the People at the end, trying to pick up the pieces of a broken and divided land. I am ready to build the bridges we need – together, we will engage those averse to ending the status quo. It starts with compassionate discourse, correcting the misinformation that has been propagated for decades, tearing down the walls of ingrained perceptions – it all begins with one conversation at a time. I am confident We the People are getting ready for the best to come in our nation’s history – I am proud to be part of this movement to reunite our great nation.

Next, Laura asked last night how do I feel about protecting Israel? This is an issue I am very passionate about not just because I have visited the country a number of times, but mainly due to the fact that President Obama has not had their interests as a sovereign nation in mind. The perfect example of this is the Nuclear Agreement with Iran, whose leadership is boldly outspoken about destroying both the United States and Israel.

Last March, Prime Minister Netanyahu came to the United States to implore the President and Congress to not approve this deal. He warned that such an agreement would do nothing to block Iran’s mission to create nuclear weapons and would be a direct threat to the Jewish state. Instead of listening to our close ally, President Obama decided to move forward with an agreement. Furthermore, the Obama administration has used information -- gathered and obtained by spying on Israel -- to counter their opposition to the U.S. nuclear arms agreement with Iran. This to me is despicable. 

Under a Carson administration, I would make it very clear that Israel and the United States have a long, historied relationship, and I don't think we should ever leave the Israelis in a position of wondering whether we support them. When I am president, I will stand firmly with Israel, and one of my first acts in office will be to revoke Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran.

Finally, Ben asks “what did you do to celebrate Dr. King on MLK day?” Thank you for the question Ben, great first name! :) 

I had the opportunity to meet so many great people at the Carolina African American Heritage Foundation today – it was truly representative of Dr. King’s message, unity personified, a people embodying the true spirit of promise and prosperity.

Today is a day to celebrate common purpose and the transformative ability of We the People – this nation was founded on the strength of our diversity, a gathering of individuals bound by unity. We are a country of legacy and determination, explorers with the distinctive ‘can-do’ attitude – it is our responsibility to carry the standard forward, lending our individual talents to better society as a whole; when we lift others up, we are all made stronger by each person’s ability to contribute their unique God-given purpose. 

It is a calling that we all must answer during this time of divisive rhetoric – we will be remembered for what we do, not what we talked about doing.

As always, thank you for allowing me into your homes and workplaces for our nightly chats. I look forward to tomorrow night!

Goodnight,
Ben",2016-01-19 02:23:15,"status",NA,"138691142964027_582407608592376",NA,8210,268,1279,NA,NA,NA

America lost one of those bright young men today. I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing. While we mourn this profound loss, I am thankful that our other campaign colleagues, Drew McCall, Aaron Ohnemus and Ryan Patrick Shellooe, have all been treated and released from the hospital. 

A presidential candidate asks a lot of his or her volunteers, working long hours in the cold, under-appreciated. They are the unsung heroes of the political process. The outpouring of support for Braden and his family from fellow candidates, as well as their staffs and volunteers, demonstrates that life will always transcend politics, and I thank them for their kind words. Please continue to keep Braden’s family and friends in your prayers as they struggle through this difficult time.

Even after more than 30 years experience counseling parents and family members in the most difficult of times, it never gets easier. But I find solace in the knowledge of God’s redeeming grace, and I pray that Braden's family finds comfort in the mercy of the Lord.

"154","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, I want to keep in touch with you because connection is so important, and the time we spend with each other on here at night is special. Please remember to keep sending me your thoughts and questions to the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).

I have spent the past days reflecting on what makes the people we call neighbors and friends so special: it is the outpouring of love that will conquer any divide, an American spirit that ceases to waver, a resolve that no man can break.

We are on a path that He is walking before us, guiding our thoughts and steps – encouraging us to walk on the water with our eyes fixed upon Him. Forward.

With that, I would like to continue our conversations, knowing that we still have so many efforts to achieve, destinations we have set out towards on this journey together. Our goal of restoring this land back to We the People is being realized on a daily basis, one person, one dialogue at a time, unifying our great nation under common purpose using common sense.

It is a testament to our movement, this bond that only strengthens each and every day as We the People continually grow – from New Hampshire and Maryland to Texas and beyond, our team is reaching new pinnacles and people, our sights are set and we are more ready than ever to keep serving the best interests of this country.

That is what this is all about: serving others so that they are lifted higher. We rise together. 

We are a nation in great need of servant leaders, occupied with offering of themselves rather than serving self interests. Our elected officials should remember that they serve at the behest of others – no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

Being a good leader is about having the will to work under those you serve. You cannot lift others by standing over them.

I am ready to serve with you, side by side, inspiring the next generation of American explorers and innovators. We the People are resolute in restoring our great nation, leading by example in service to this country.

Again, thank you for spending tonight with me as we walk this path together.

"172","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, I wanted to make sure we had some time again for our nightly chat. I’ve been reading so many of your thoughts, prayers and questions – please keep sending them to me by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Being on the road, traveling from city to city, town hall to home, it makes the road a great place to keep connected with you by reading your texts. So, here we go…

The first question tonight comes from Ann, she asks “what values do you think our next President should emphasize to the country?”

Great question, Ann. Values are important, not just because you hear everyone talk about how important they are, but they are the underpinnings of a moral society. Integrity, courage, humility, compassion, commitment and being inspirational are the foundation of this country, and We the People must be encouraged to place values over volume – life is a precious thing to waste on misplaced priorities. 

What we place on pedestals is what we allow to govern our lives – I place Him, who is righteous and sovereign, on that place of authority.

You can’t touch ‘values’, but you can surely be touched by those who value you, enriching those around them with every word spoken in love and encouragement for life, healed by the hands of one who seeks to lift you up rather than put you down. Instead of looking to promote divisiveness, that only seeks to steal and destroy, our focus should be reviving relationships, not rhetoric. 

Up next is Emily, who asks “what role does ‘faith’ play in your life?”

Simply put, Emily: vitally first. An even more important question though, is “what is my role in faith?”. Without first understanding “who I am in Him”, I wouldn’t be able to live my faith according to His will and purpose in my life. Aligning myself in the Lord allows me to walk in step with Him – I would surely falter and veer if not for His guidance. Discernment is only possible when we hear His voice, and that takes time to develop, which means a lot of walking and talking.

It is easy to get wrapped up in the world, it will dominate you if you do not act upon the dominion given to you – the challenges we face on a daily basis are tempered only by the acknowledgement of the role we play in relation to our fellow man and God. It really comes down to the greatest role of all: a servant leader. 

When we serve others, we lead each other to mutual prosperity, growth and learning – it is ultimately to honor the value and dignity God has innately given to each individual. That is why we must place life at such a paramount – not for the sake of ourselves – but for the plan and purpose He has placed in each and every person created in His image. We are intended to be a mirror of Him, a reflection of His love and patience, speaking life into one another as He spoke life into us.

Yes, Emily, faith plays a vital role in my life and that of my family – it is just as important that I understand my role in God according to the example He has given.

Finally tonight, Adam had a comment about the video I posted on Facebook tonight, where I reminisced about the speech I gave at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. I’m sure you all remember that one; even though it was my second time speaking at the Prayer Breakfast – Reverend Billy Graham notably spoke at this event twice as well – this always seems to be a popular topic of discussion. Adam noted that ever since he watched that video, many years ago on YouTube, he wanted me to run for President. 

Adam, as you watched in the video from today, I didn’t fully realize the impact it would have until I started hearing from so many just like you. And, thank you for the kind words in your message – I too want to secure a brighter future for our next generation by being courageous, despite being told to “be quiet”.

But, we cannot be silent any longer – I am inspired by the boldness I see in We the People every day I meet with you. Whether it’s on the road, at a town hall or even here on Facebook when I read your comments – I am so proud to walk this road with you, to fight this good fight. We will be victorious – not because of our own wants and desires, but for our children. They deserve better from us and it is our responsibility to provide the opportunity for them to prosper.

After reading so many of your messages, I was reminded of my granddaughter Tesora, who some of you might have seen at one of our town halls. She is the reason I am running for President. Candy and I could not look into her eyes, holding the future in our very arms, and wonder about the day that might come when she asked us “why?” The time is now for us to hold ourselves accountable not only to each other, but to our precious little ones. I am ready to lead the way with you, restoring our great nation to its preeminence, the land of opportunity that America is distinctively known for.

As always, thank you for spending your evening with me and I look forward to tomorrow night. Hopefully you stay warm as I hear there is a big storm coming. Stay safe.

Goodnight,

"175","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s another night to spend together during our nightly chat. Remember to keep texting your questions and thoughts to the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). 

The first question tonight is from Matt who asks about my “perspective on the March for Life” event today.

Matt, I can tell you that I am 100% Pro Life. Period. There is nothing more valuable than our precious little ones and it is our responsibility to protect them. If is not only a personal matter of my faith – it goes beyond that. 

We can see the ramifications of a society that does not value life, little by little, people are no longer viewed as the potential for greatness our country so desperately needs. Terms like “viable” start remove the personal aspect and inherent dignity every person deserves.

I find it interesting that most who are proponents of “pro choice” negate the choice of the unborn – lucky for them, they were given the ability to “choose” for another, unable to speak from the womb. But, a picture is worth a thousand words and all it takes is one look at an ultrasound and you know what you see is a life.

Also, how will we ever have a future when we are negating the future leaders and innovators of this world to ever be born? It doesn’t make any sense to me.

The next question comes from Mary. She wants to know how the town halls are going in Iowa. She had the opportunity to watch our recent live streams on Facebook and wants to know if there will be more.

Yes, Mary, there will be more. I view this as a great opportunity to connect with even more people on a daily basis. Just like these nightly chats we have here, I think it always best to ‘remove the curtain’ and let you keep in touch with me in a genuine way – up close and personal, transparent and honest.

The town halls are going well – my team has told me there have been tens of thousands of questions and comments. I’m still working on reading them. :)  What I’ve consistently found – whether it is your comments you send by text or the thoughts you share with me in person – is that you are tired of being told one thing and see another being done, mostly behind closed doors. There is no accountability anymore and it seems like we try the same thing over and over again, thinking “this will be the time they keep their promise”, only to be let down once again.

The answer: stop placing our hopes and dreams in the palms of flawed human beings – rather, let Him guide our hopes and place our Trust In God. That is the answer. Politicians will most certainly say whatever they feel is expedient, serving their own interests, not that of We the People. As I’ve said many times before, luckily, I’m not a politician and I will never be. I look to be of service to others, not having others serve me. The status quo is on notice and you are making them listen.

Lastly, Brian asks “did you get to build any snowmen today?” Apparently Brian heard there was a lot of snow from the blizzard we just had.

Unfortunately, Brian, I didn’t get to build any snowmen, but I will be sure to look out for some pictures! Maybe I will see if someone from the team can grab a picture for you. :)

I hope everyone stayed safe today during the snowfall and I’m so appreciative to my team throughout the country that are still working hard to reach you – knocking on doors, putting up yard signs and traveling across the country to make this movement what it is today. The important Iowa caucus is only days away and it will be the first of many times we really need you to carry the progress that you and I have built up to this point to the next level – it starts in Iowa and every little bit you do makes the biggest of differences. Ready and resolute I stand with you as we make our voices heard!

Again, thank you for allowing me into your homes, I can’t wait for what tomorrow holds.

"180","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, I wanted to make sure I had a little bit of time with you tonight. It’s been a busy day, as most of you have seen on Facebook with our town halls and live streaming the Revive 714 event. It’s been a great reading your comments and thoughts from the road – keep them coming by texting to the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).

I’ve been reminded of the servant leadership role throughout the many stops in Iowa – whether it is a mother and father with their children, an off-duty police officer or military member to teachers and nurses. We are all working together, in our own special way, to inspire others, lift each other up during a time when division seems more prevalent.

You are making the difference. I can see it – it is tangible and can be felt. The young child that is given the encouragement and empowerment they yearn for in the classroom. You are doing that. The lives you save, whether in the operating room or on the streets you keep safe. You are securing life. The hands you join hand-in-hand as you pray for our precious little ones without a voice. You are being the voice for the voiceless. You are about our Father’s work and I am honored to lead with you.

If only our elected officials viewed these as victories rather than pitting us against each other for political gain. What a misnomer…political gain. What is “gained” by dividing people, promoting victimization and strife. I don’t know about you, but I am tired of being told “be quiet” or “that’s just how things work in politics”. Enough is enough and We the People will not take it any longer! Iowa is days away and the movement will not be stopped. I’m ready to return this country back into the hands it rightly belongs to, I am resolute in our promise to restore our great nation.

"186","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s another night that we get to spend together for our nightly chat. Remember, keep sending me your texts using the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let’s jump right in.

The first question is from Jeremy and he asks about my new cyber security plan, “how does this tie into ‘national security’?”

I’m glad you asked Jeremy. This has everything to do with national security – the job of the President of the United States, first and foremost, is to secure our country and defend its borders from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I mean all borders, physical and digital. We live in a new age of tactics and an evolving battlefield – it is unconventional and asymmetrical. 

Not only do we need to have the most robust military fighting force in history, with the intention of peace through strength, but also the capabilities to thwart both domestic and international terrorism through our digital infrastructure. With so much of our data and information being stored and transmitted electronically, we must be able to secure our national interests by putting in place safeguards to prevent theft. Our financial stability and future rests on the assuredness and proactive thinking our country deserves – and, I know the spirit of American ingenuity will shine in this new frontier.

The next question is from Emily who asks about the “importance of our 2nd Amendment, the right to bear arms.” She stressed to me how important this issue is to her and wanted to know if I am committed to protecting her right to defend both herself and her family.

No question Emily, I fully support the Second Amendment. 100%. This question ties back into the previous one about “security”. It is paramount that a free society be able to defend itself, that is the distinguishing characteristic of a free people. It is also important that you elect a leader that understands the paramount nature and genesis of our right to bear arms: not only do we need a “ready and able” citizenry for the militia if need be, but even more importantly, it is for the people to be able to defend itself against a tyrannical centralized government which might oppress its people. History is a great reminder and we need look no further than the formation of our own nation to see an example of this. Lest we forget.

Let me be clear: I will not infringe upon the guaranteed right of our law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. Period. We have vilified those who look to protect themselves and their families long enough, it’s time we started focusing our attention to those who openly call for our destruction. I believe in We the People and I’m confident you do too.

Finally, Melissa asks “who’s more competitive, you or Ms. Candy?” 

Well, Melissa, I have to admit, I am more competitive. But don’t let her know it, I like to tell her I let her win, but the truth is, she actually beats me at games more often than not, even at pool! That’s what I love about her; she’s dignified even when she beats me, that’s the kind of woman she is. Humble and loving, she can make me laugh like no one else. The smile on her face when she can tell exactly what I’m thinking. She is my best friend, and if I’m going to get beat by someone, who better than the one who makes me a better person. But, I still like to think I’m better at pool, but she has me beat when it comes to musical talent!

Again, thank you for letting me into your homes to spend this time with you. It always brings a smile to my face when I read your messages. It’s only a couple more days until We the People make our voices heard in Iowa and I’m excited to see you on the road, and beyond.

"194","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s another night that we get to spend together during our nightly fireside chat. It’s been another great day in Iowa – from getting to meet so many of you at Revive 714 and talking to Sean Hannity about how We the People will restore faith in our great nation to seeing so many of our team hitting the ground hard, the February 1st Iowa Caucus can’t come soon enough! Remember, keep sending me your thoughts and comments by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).

The first question tonight comes from Ryan who asks “what are your thoughts concerning the Justice Department going after the people who exposed Planned Parenthood’s negligent practices?”

Ryan, thank you for this important question. As I have said repeatedly – the moment we start devaluing human life is the moment we lose our humanity. Without life, we have no hope for a future, tomorrow will never come – we must not allow ourselves to become callous and indifferent to the slaughter of our most precious little ones. They are our hope. They are our future. No longer can we let these children's unrealized potential go unchecked into perpetuity. 

We have witnessed those who tried being a voice for the voiceless now being targeted by this administration’s Justice Department, an attempt to silence their plea for increased scrutiny regarding these heinous acts performed by Planned Parenthood – I will not stand idly by and allow this to go unnoticed or brushed aside. I ask that you visit crsn.co/1KD9FBH and stand with me against these barbaric practices.

The next question comes from Ruth. She asks “do you feel the same way about the government and its overreach as I do?” Ruth commented that she feels our government has become far too large and overreaching, especially for small businesses.

Yes, Ruth, I agree. The truth of the matter is government has come to resemble a ‘Leviathan’ presence in America. It is lethargic and inefficient, reaching into our lives in ways our Founding Fathers never intended. Though, this is not “something new under the sun” – we have been having this very discussion for far too long, only to have politicians promise “reform”, as if they are listening… The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome. We the People have been ignored and pandered to enough, now it is time for the government to listen to us!

Our nation cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road, allowing the pervasive hand of government to dictate our prosperity or outcomes: not from our homes, not from our places of business, and certainly not our places of worship.

Americans are innovators and entrepreneurs, when given the proper free-market environment for individuals, families and businesses the opportunity to thrive, We the People outperform the competition time and time again. It is in our national DNA – we are an accomplished people with so much to share, if only the government bureaucrats would cut the red tape, that would be the real stimulus needed to jumpstart the American engine of ingenuity. I am ready to fuel this restoration with you and return this country back into the hands of We the People. Enough is enough.

Finally, Eddie asks “what is the hardest thing about running for President?”

Eddie, I won’t lie – running for President is not easy and I often have to spend a lot of time away from my family. They keep me centered and grounded. At the end of the day, there is nothing like spending quality time with them, and without their support, this would not be possible. I am blessed to have them by my side. The next hardest thing is seeing the trajectory of our country and being so passionate about “sounding the alarm” – often, we can feel as if “I’m only one voice, does it make a difference?”. I can tell you with absolute certainty: one voice can echo throughout history. You are that voice that is multiplied many times over. I can see it in the eyes of everyone I meet – it is passion, zeal and a resolute mindset that will fight for this country at each and every impasse. Americans have a distinct quality of fighters, and they wear many different uniforms, many without nametags. I am so proud to fight by your side and We the People are stronger now more than ever.

As always, thank you for spending the evening with me for our nightly chat. I look forward to tomorrow and beyond.

"202","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s been another great day in Iowa as I prepare for tomorrow night’s debate on Fox News – I’m looking forward to putting We the People front and center stage! Please remember to keep sending me texts throughout the day using the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let’s jump into tonight’s questions.

The first question tonight is from Hal, he asks about “common core” and it’s “detrimental effect on effective learning in the classroom.” Thank you for asking Hal, you know education is one of my passions.

I have been, and always will be, a proponent for facilitating learning environments that enrich our students, reward excellence and motivate our young ones to dream beyond their current circumstances. A student’s mind is more than eager to absorb even more than we often give credit, ready to be challenged and stretched. That is my issue with “Common Core” is it lacks Common Sense – why would we place bureaucratic impediments and barriers to learning in front of students, more focused on rote and regurgitation, there is nothing intellectually stimulating about this debacle. There’s a lot of rhyme without much reason.

What I will advocate for is empowering local communities, states, parents and students to explore the many opportunities a free-market approach to education will produce: performance-driven curriculum that engages students and allows our amazing teachers to get back to their passion, which is enriching students. The math is simple on this one.

Next, James asks about ISIS and their “seemingly emboldened” international posture, specifically towards America and Israel.

Timely question James, and yes, I agree. The more we allow these Radical Islamic Terrorists to carry out their mission, unchecked, the more their ranks will feel untouchable. A cancer that is allowed to grow will spread its tentacles until the body is decimated – I, for one, will not allow our hands to sit idly by. As Commander-in-Chief, it will be my priority to protect American interests and innocent lives, of all creeds and religions, from the pointed threats of those championing death rather than life. Period.

The time for wishful thinking and capitulation is over – we must not allow the spine of America to be planted firmly in the sand. It will require decisive action with clear and measurable objectives and goals – this war will not be fought from the rear. We are a nation of leaders and operators, a country rooted in bold distinction, ever present to thwart evil when it rears its head. I am confident that given the proper leadership, coalescing our international allies in common purpose, the United States will once again reestablish itself as the force for peace through strength, stability through anchored positional readiness.

It starts with calling out the enemy by name. Let’s make it official.

Finally, Karaina asks “are you prepared for the debate? What do you think about Mr. Trump not showing up?”

Prepared, yes. The thing is, Karaina, we should always be prepared to give an account and answer. Whether it is walking on the debate stage, speaking to large crowds at our town halls, or engaging with people every day on the numerous stops throughout the country, I am at ease knowing that I am prepared to talk about important matters because I’m not a politician, I’m person, just like you. It’s not about “sound bites”, it’s about sound guidance, wisdom and principles. Those are the core of whatever topic it is I’m addressing. As long as you have your foundation firmly rooted in the truth, facts are sure to follow. It’s common sense.

As far as Mr. Trump possibly not participating in the debate, I don’t really think that any one candidate should be the focus – remember, this is about We the People and representing a multitude of people on that stage tomorrow night, and every day thereafter.

Again, thank you for the great questions, I always enjoy spending our evenings together for these chats.

Goodnight,
Ben",2016-01-28 03:08:28,"status",NA,"138691142964027_586446284855175",NA,9404,455,1251,NA,NA,NA

He proved himself the best qualified candidate in the 2016 presidential race, addressing common sense solutions to the problems and concerns of the American People, demonstrating he is committed to keeping them safe and has the economic plans to make them prosper.
 
Dr. Carson proved he is a uniter, not a divider, setting aside pettiness of ""politics as usual"" and focusing on the solutions that will heal our nation.  He is the only candidate with the moral character and authority to lead America as Commander-in-Chief. Ignoring political correctness, tackling bullies like Putin, defeating ISIS and restoring our global leadership requires moral courage, not political expediency.
 
The debate stage is one of many avenues that Dr. Carson has used to share his vision to heal, inspire and revive America.  His website, www.BenCarson.com has more detailed policy positions than any other candidate, offering further proof that Dr. Carson is the most prepared to step into the Oval Office and lead from Day One.

"234","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello everyone, it’s another night we get to spend together for our nightly chat. Please remember to keep sending me your thoughts and questions by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let’s jump right in!

First, I wanted to thank the thousands of you who sent me your prayers and well-wishes yesterday before the debate – it always centers me and puts me in the right frame of mind to know who I am fighting for, We the People. So much attention has been given to “sound bite sensationalism” and pitting this person against that one – we must always remember that this is not about ‘them’, it is about us. The future we sow will be what our children reap, and I am confident, together, we will be planting the seeds for our children to bear the fruit of a prosperous tomorrow.

Division and demonization are not the answer – it is healthy to recognize ‘differences’ that are inherent in our ‘melting pot’ society steeped in tradition and common purpose, unique perspectives and voices are at the very essence of our nation’s formation. However, when we lose sight of our commonality – to the point of demeaning rhetoric and dehumanizing insult – our neighbor becomes nothing more than an accumulation of ‘material’, without dignity and meaning. 

I refuse to belittle, We the People are bigger – it’s time “politicians” learn how to lift ideas up rather than pushing other people down. This election means more than the person who will hold the office of President because the American people ultimately govern from that desk, and I’m not quite sure there’s enough room for one man’s ego and We the People to fit at the same time.

Before I head off to bed, I’d like to answer Don’s question about last night; he asked “were you frustrated about the lack of time and questions you got during the debate?” This was a common response from many of you, so I wanted to make sure I shared my thoughts with you on this.

Yes and no, Don. No, I wasn’t personally frustrated over the lack of time I was given – I don’t think it takes a verbose and drawn-out answer to get to the point. According to the reporting, I had the “lowest time” answering on stage, but I always prefer quality over quantity. On the same note, however, I do wish that more time was spent getting to the focus of this debate: the American people. There was plenty of “back and forth”, from side to side on that stage, not enough discussion about giving this country back to We the People, forthright solutions that speak directly to a divided America. Let’s leave the bickering on the playground, this is not a game. 

I stand with you – not over you. We the People are united in actually solving problems, telling it like it is – who cares about scoring political points when the score always ends up zero. We all lose when we fall divided, but, united we stand. Let’s get back to winning again. I am confident we will secure the victory Americans are known for, time and time again, leading the way for others to follow.

As always, thank you for allowing me into your homes for another night together, just We the People connecting without all the noise. It’s always a highlight of my day.

"239","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Today, I am proud to release my Immigration Plan which will secure the border, reform immigration and restore the rule of law. I believe, as Teddy Roosevelt did, that anyone who comes to this country and wants to be a part of it must accept our laws, our Constitution and our values. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a sovereign nation of laws. Our sovereignty demands that we protect our borders and make decisions for ourselves, including whom to welcome onto our soil. Our rule of law requires that we uphold the laws – including immigration laws – that the American people have duly enacted.

All the while, terrorists and criminals are doing everything they can to infiltrate our country. We must do better to protect the homeland while continuing the tradition of welcoming new Americans. Legal immigration will always be a valued pillar of our society, but we need to restore the rule of law and keep this country safe and sovereign. 

As president, I will repair our immigration system and do the following: 1) secure the border, 2) implement sensible admission and removal procedures, 3) solve the problem of the existing illegal immigrant population in the United States, 4) address legal immigration and 5) restore the concept of the American melting pot.",2016-01-31 17:15:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_588088318024305",NA,14810,311,2186,NA,NA,NA

For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it. Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign - in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes.

One of the reasons I got into this race was to stop these deceptive and destructive practices, and these reports have only further steeled my resolve to continue and fight for ‘We The People,’ and return control of the government back to them.

My first question is from Sumter who asks “how important is it, really, to protect our borders?” 

I believe the border is our first line of defense against illegal immigration. Border security is about upholding America’s laws as well as defending U.S. national security. Currently, terrorists and criminals are eagerly entering our country. We must stop them or we will risk more tragedies like the death of Kate Steinle, a young woman who was shot in San Francisco last summer. The man accused of perpetrating the crime was an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times but still managed to sneak back into this country. Preventable crimes like that should never happen, and they will not happen when I am president. A Carson administration will enforce a multi-faceted approach to securing our borders, based upon the successful model that had been implemented in Yuma, Arizona, prior to intervention from the Obama administration. 

Next, Kate asks “why do you support school choice?” 

Kate, the fact is the United States cannot remain competitive in the world if we do not have an education system that meets the needs of students in every corner of our country. It is our moral imperative as Americans to lay the foundation for a world class education for every student, not simply to those in the best neighborhoods or with the money to buy the educational support they need. We must adopt policies that will give parents and students the freedom to design an educational experience that is tailored to their unique abilities, interests and learning needs.

Finally, Anthony asks “how do we address the constant approach of ‘government-based’ solutions we always here about?” Anthony indicated that he thinks too many politicians seem to think “government” is the answer.

Anthony, I agree with you. Why do we keep looking to government for the answer? It is We the People that have, and always will be the answer. It’s time to return to common sense solutions that enrich the American people, not line the pockets of bureaucrats with special favors. Back room deals will have no place in my administration, that I promise – it will actually be transparent for once.

Thank you again for letting me into your homes for our nightly chat.

I would like to spend tonight talking briefly about principles and integrity. 

What does a society have if not a foundation to build upon – the angles must be level and true if our institutions are to stand, unwavering whilst the wind blows to and fro. Our aim and direction must never be dictated from a faulty compass, a broken-off island that drifts in the ocean without bearing. 

You must plant yourself firm and steady, that is when you are able to clearly see the immovable waypoint. Truth is objective and you won’t find gradations of integrity on your ruler, nor degrees of honesty on your thermometer. There is one standard, and interpretation should be left to art critics, not public servants.

It is easy to become disheartened and “removed” from our political process when we see advantageous maneuvering and games being played – however, that is why I am running for President. The time for games is over, We the People aren’t in the mood. 

I’m ready for an American restoration, bringing people together with common purpose – that is our story and the chapters to come are already being written by you. Each page, a new adventure and victory. Our children will read about it, and we will know what it took to secure a future beyond the horizon, a tomorrow that is worth saving – an America that highlights the authors of prosperity, a land joined hand in hand, where victory rests in the hands of We the People.

Again, thank you for spending some time with me this evening – whether in your homes with your family or even still at work, I appreciate these moments when we can truly connect.

Please keep sending me all of your questions by texting 275-236 (ASKBEN), so that I can answer them and tell you about all of the exciting solutions I've proposed to Heal, Inspire and Revive our great nation.

Tonight I want to discuss the state of politics in our country. Already this year, as in every year, there are countless reports of dirty tricks, shady practices, and outright lies intended to get voters by any means possible. Unfortunately, these deceptive practices have become ""business as usual"" for the political class. It's disheartening to see, but it's also a reminder of why I got into this race in the first place. I'm not here to play the same sleazy games that have become routine in American politics. I'm running to return integrity to our politics.

I can't speak for other campaigns. I can only tell you this: I promise to always run a campaign that is reflective of my character and Christian values. I think how we conduct our campaigns says a lot about how we lead, and I want the American people to know that I will always lead with integrity and honesty. Washington politicians will do anything to keep power, resorting to any dirty trick. I got in this race to break that cycle of political gamesmanship and return the White House to ""We the People.""

So while I'm saddened to see the tactics employed by some of my fellow Republicans, I won't let it change who I am or how I run. I want to thank all of my supporters for their continued faith. And to any supporter in Iowa who feels they were deceived, I'm honored by your support. I will carry this fight on.

"288","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Good evening friends, It’s great to be able to sit down with you again for our nightly Ask Ben chat. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions at 275-236 (ASKBEN).

I get a lot of questions about my views on the debate process, so I thought I’d discuss it some this evening. Public debates are an important opportunity for the American people to hear directly from their candidates. We spend so much time trying to spread our messages, but between the media distortions, the negative ads and political rumor mills, everything get’s pretty jumbled. There is no room for that kind of distortion when we get on the debate stage, just as I will tomorrow night in New Hampshire. That’s why I think it’s important for every candidate to participate.

I have called for a change to the debate process in order to make sure all candidates are given more equitable opportunities to answer questions and that the stage itself is representative of the entirety of the Republican Party. We need to begin by getting rid of the ‘Coliseum’ mentality that is driving moderators to instigate fights between candidates. We should be answering substantive questions about how we will fix the problems facing America today. That is why I always try to stay above the fray, even if it means sacrificing time in the spotlight. I am also interested in seeing a more collegial format -- where the candidates can discuss issues less formally, and with longer speaking times allotted. This will provide an opportunity for candidates to fully convey their positions on the issues rather than creating sound bites for the news.

No matter the format, I will eagerly take the stage at any debate. It is a privilege to be running for President, and I am immensely grateful to We the People for the support that they have shown me throughout this process.",2016-02-06 02:30:01,"status",NA,"138691142964027_590886654411138",NA,9692,719,1057,NA,NA,NA

"302","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","At tonight’s ABC GOP Presidential Debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, Dr. Ben Carson delivered a commanding performance characterized by quiet strength and strong moral convictions. 

He appealed to the best qualities of the American people and acknowledged that “America would not be free without our veterans.” Dr. Carson also emphasized that the prevailing ethics of Washington are not his ethics. While career politicians are happy to do whatever is necessary to win, Dr. Carson stressed that he will do what is right. He is confident that he will beat Secretary Hillary Clinton in the general election because the American people will choose honest and integrity instead of deceit and the Washington way.

On stage, where other candidates chose self-promotion and bickering, Dr. Carson opted for civility and respect, breaking through the name-calling and personal attacks to address the serious issues facing the American people. Last week in Iowa, when Washington insiders stooped to efforts to unfairly manipulate voters, Dr. Carson stood strong for integrity and accountability. Throughout this race, while politicians have engaged in empty rhetoric, Dr. Carson has offered real common sense solutions backed by a lifetime of accomplishment. 

Tonight, voters in New Hampshire and across the country are the real winners, as they saw for themselves a leader who will make tough decisions based on his moral compass, not according to political correctness or expediency.

Our first question tonight comes from Emily. Emily wants to know how I feel about the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and what message I would have for voters in the state.

Great question, Emily! First and foremost, I am very much looking forward to the New Hampshire Primary tomorrow and I am confident that the people of the Granite State will cast their votes with conviction and careful consideration. As to what I would say to voters in the state; I would want to make sure that people know that as President, I will fiercely defend the Constitution of the United States, secure our borders and safeguard our nation from any threat. Most importantly, I will do what is in the best interest of We the People and not capitulate to special interests and the political elite. If the people of New Hampshire honor me with their votes, I promise to be a candidate of integrity who will follow through on the promises that I have made during this election process.

Our second question tonight comes from Lauren. Lauren wants to know what my thoughts were on this past weekend’s debate and how I feel about the debate process in general.

Thank you so much for the question, Lauren. I believe that the debate process is an important part of the public being able to better get to know the candidates and for the candidates to be able to share their ideas with the American people as well as debate them in a public setting. Furthermore, we need to make sure that every candidate has an equal opportunity to present their ideas and need to get away from arbitrary debate requirements. I thought this past debate went very well and that people are starting to realize that I am a candidate with real ideas and real solutions to the many problems facing our nation. If you want to learn more about where I stand on the issues, you can read more at bencarson.com/issues.

Our final question tonight comes from Alex. Alex is a student who wants to know what I would do to improve the education system in our country.

That’s a great question, Alex! The problems facing our education system are complex. First of all, I think that if we take a serious look at Common Core, it will prove that the piece of legislation has very little common sense.  I believe that we need to fundamentally reshape the way that we think about education in this country. We can begin by offering alternatives such as voucher and charter school programs so that every student can reach their full potential. I also believe that we need to not think about our education system as a “one-size-fits-all” program. What works for Massachusetts does not necessarily work for Louisiana. We need to place more educational power in the hands of the states, not in the hands of the Washington bureaucracy.

Thank you so much for checking in with me tonight and please continue to send in your questions. Looking forward to a great day in New Hampshire tomorrow! - Ben",2016-02-09 02:30:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_592427807590356",NA,7574,412,821,NA,NA,NA

"329","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Good evening, Friends. It’s time for yet another evening chat. Keep texting in your thoughts and questions at 275-236 (ASKBEN).

I get a lot of questions about the the environment, and specifically the Obama Administration’s many executive orders and overreaching rules. Yesterday we finally saw the Supreme Court stand up to the President on one such rule. While they stopped short of ruling on the Clean Power Plan’s emissions restrictions on power plants, the Supreme Court did issue a stay preventing the rule’s enforcement for now. This latest attempt by the EPA to control and reinvent our energy sector by executive action is shameful. Despite the complete lack of regulatory authority, the EPA director and climate alarmists remain committed to imposing their agenda regardless of the law or even the will of the people.

This is the most alarming part of this court case. It has shown just how little regard the administration has for We the People. Democrats are willing to use any means at their disposal to radically change our country, and the Constitution, along with Constitutional principles such as the separation of powers and federalism, have repeatedly been the victims of their assault. Our next president must be a vigilant defender of the Constitution, and if elected I promise to always abide by our founding principals; and to appoint justices who will do likewise. We cannot afford another President who will erode our liberty or our laws.

As for encouraging cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy sources, federal mandates are the wrong course of action. We should encourage free market investment to innovate new technologies and methods. Artificial restrictions on energy sources only hurt consumers by raising prices. If we want a vibrant, affordable and cleaner energy sector, we need to let companies compete. That’s the only way to ensure that the American people will continue to have access to the affordable and reliable energy they need.",2016-02-11 02:30:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_593334440833026",NA,9683,568,1261,NA,NA,NA

Our first question tonight comes from Kaitlin. Kaitlin wants to know when I become President what my plan is to defeat ISIS and bring peace to the Middle East.

Great question, Kaitlin. I believe in a hands-on approach to defeating ISIS that will involve collaboration with our allies in the region and by giving our military leaders the resources that they need to accomplish the mission. We must wage war against our enemy both abroad and at home, by fundamentally rooting out radical Islamic factions and destroying them both militarily and ideologically. As President I will fight ISIS, its affiliates, and other terrorist groups wherever we find them; from Iraq and Syria to Libya and the Maghreb. That includes fighting the spread of their radical ideology here in the US as well. Radical Islamic terrorists seek to oppress free people around the world, and a Carson Administration will settle for nothing less than the destruction of this murderous and tyrannical ideology.

Our second question tonight comes from Tyrone. He wants to know what I will do to improve the lives of our nation’s veterans.

Great question. I think that it’s important to recognize that the Obama administration has not treated our veterans with the respect that they deserve. It is disgraceful that more than 20 military members are committing suicide every single day. Our service men and women deserve the best treatment and care available for serving in our armed forces. We need a comprehensive system in place for re-introducing former personnel into society that is seamless. Additionally, we need to provide exceptional psychological and physical treatment services for those that need our help. That's why I've introduced a health care plan that will provide America's veterans with medical coverage from day one of their transition to civilian life, ensuring no American service member is ever left behind. Implementing this kind of comprehensive reform to our veterans services will not be an easy undertaking, but our service men and women are more than deserving of such care.

Our third and final question tonight comes from Jessica who wants to know what is my favorite part of running for President of United States.

Thanks for the question! The simple answer is that my favorite part of running for President is being able to connect with the American people and learn first-hand about the issues that they find important. This election has always been about restoring power to We the People and taking it out of the hands of an out-of-control, bureaucratic government. Therefore, my greatest joy on the campaign trail is getting to meet the people that I am fighting for and having the opportunity to discuss my ideas for how we can revive our nation.

The first question tonight is from Rick who is struggling to find work and wants to know what my plan is to grow the American economy and bring jobs back to the United States.

Thank you for the question Rick and let me begin by saying that President Obama’s administration and liberal progressives in Congress have crippled our economy with egregiously high tax thresholds that stifle economic growth and force American jobs overseas. My flat tax proposal will allow more people to keep more of their money and increase the economic growth from the current anemic 2.2% to a significantly improved 4% annual growth. Additionally, under my plan, lower corporate tax rates will incentivize foreign companies to invest in our economy, and will encourage American companies to stay in the United States, which will lead to more jobs for hardworking American citizens. By taking these steps, we will begin to build our economy by very simply keeping more money out of the hands of the federal government and in the pockets of We the People.

Joshua is a recent college graduate who wants to know what my plan is to reform our current student loan system and how I would lessen the burden of student debt.

The high costs of obtaining a college degree has limited the control of many college graduates over their futures. In response to increasingly high student loan costs, President Obama has responded with more federal bureaucracy and by taking control of the student loan process. I will simplify and streamline the financial aid system to make it easier for students and families to make informed decisions. I will also reverse President Obama’s nationalization of the student loan market and welcome private sector participation in providing information and financing. This will create a student loan process that favors the American people and not the federal government.

Thank you again for sending me your questions. Be sure to tune in for the Republican Debate tomorrow night on CBS. I’m very much looking forward to having the opportunity to further present my ideas to the American people.",2016-02-13 02:00:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_594343164065487",NA,11328,499,1288,NA,NA,NA

"356","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","I am saddened to hear the news about Justice Antonin Scalia. We have lost a great man and a great Supreme Court Justice. For the past three decades, his towering intellect and trenchant wit has characterized the deliberations and decisions of the high court. He made Americans proud, not only because he gave to the court the power and persuasion of his brilliant legal mind, but because he defended the Constitution with an unshakeable commitment to the text and to the intent of the Founders. In an age where it is popular to subscribe to a ""living Constitution"" and during a time when political and judicial leaders prefer legal decisions that are politically convenient, Justice Scalia always dutifully carried out his responsibilities to interpret the law, not to make new ones. Time and again, he ruled based on where the black letter of the law led him, not according to the politics of the moment. For that reason, he has angered Americans on both the left and the right, but he has never wavered in his dedication to the Constitution.

It is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish Justice Scalia’s legacy by trying to nominate an individual who would carry on the President’s wishes to subvert the will of the people. Given the dire condition our democracy currently finds itself under Obama's lack of leadership, I call on the Senate to stop any attempts to fill this crucial seat until We The People elect a strong Constitutionalist this November.

We will miss him sorely. We pray for his family and friends, and we pray for America, which today lost a patriot and a faithful servant.",2016-02-13 23:48:37,"status",NA,"138691142964027_594898944009909",NA,49726,1037,6308,NA,NA,NA

"363","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","At tonight’s CBS News Republican Presidential Debate in Greenville, South Carolina, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, showed that when he speaks, people listen. He reminded viewers they do not have to settle for business as usual in Washington, but can choose a candidate who will always represent the greatness and goodness of the American people. 
 
On the stage, Dr. Carson offered voters a view of a future commander-in-chief with judgment – honed in the real world solving unprecedented, complex problems – that supersedes political rhetoric or experience. The viewing audience also saw that Dr. Carson’s readiness for the White House is coupled by his decency. As other candidates engaged in bickering, Dr. Carson called for healing across this land. 

Throughout this election, Washington insiders have run their campaigns based on D.C. values, but Dr. Carson has stayed true to faith, integrity and accountability. While other candidates have talked about improving the country, Dr. Carson has saved lives, protected the unborn, helped our veterans heal, provided inspiration to young people in impoverished neighborhoods, offered common-sense solutions to this country’s challenges and stood proudly for American values.
 
Tonight, voters in South Carolina and across the country saw for themselves a compelling presidential candidate with quiet strength, an authentic personal faith and strong moral conviction who is accountable to all and beholden to none.

It’s been an amazing day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, and I just wanted to take a few minutes to answer a question that I received from a supporter today. As always, please continue to text your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).

Ryan in South Carolina wants to know what steps I will take as President to reform our federal government and to tackle the corruption and bureaucracy in Washington D.C.

Thank you for the question. I have laid out on my website, bencarson.com, a detailed five step plan to reshape our federal government and to make it an entity that is first and foremost accountable to the American people. We must ensure that our leaders are held to high standards of performance and that that they meet the objectives that are crucial to the success of our nation. In order to accomplish this, we must first establish a criteria for analyzing the resources that are needed for our government to accomplish any given job and to then make sure that they receive what is needed to follow the job through to completion. 

However, revamping the current system will not be enough. We must experiment to seek out new forms of efficiency in our government and implement whatever successful course eliminates waste and unnecessary spending.  I want our government to be a body that is beholden to We the People, and so I propose that we create a system in which our government receives feedback from taxpaying, law-abiding citizens on how the government can better meet their needs. To further include our citizens in the happenings of their federal government, I propose that our government should be made to submit regular reports on the progress and cost-effectiveness of their decisions. I desire a streamlined communication process that is transparent and 100% accountable.

Thank you for the great question! I am looking forward to another great day tomorrow in South Carolina and I hope to see many of you at our upcoming events. - Ben",2016-02-16 02:31:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_595822960584174",NA,4734,326,977,NA,NA,NA

"384","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello, Friends! Thank you for joining me for our evening chats, where I get a chance to answer your questions. Please continue to text your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).

The question that I wanted to answer tonight comes from Sarah in South Carolina who wants to know about my plan for the future of health care in our country.

Thank you for the question, Sarah. I believe when it comes to healthcare, that we need to put the power back into the hands of the American people. Under Obamacare, citizens are being forced to purchase health care coverage that they don’t want while a once vibrant medical industry is stifled by regulation and unable to fulfill the demands of the market. We need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that gets the government out of the health care industry.

Additionally, I am advocating for Health Empowerment Accounts (HEA) which will give patients increased options and lower costs for basic medical needs. The beauty of an HEA is that it remains with a patient whether they change employers or move to another state -- which means that you will never lose coverage. My HEA plan is designed to also be transferable between family members, which will empower people to have the flexibility to meet their specific medical needs. 

Finally, unlike Obamacare, my plan encourages market-based solutions to our health care coverage needs that will naturally keep prices low by fostering competition among many providers. I want our health care system to be easy, flexible, and malleable to fit the unique needs and circumstances of every individual patient. Alternatively, our government has created a system that is self-serving and designed to place cumbersome restrictions on the free market. My plan will get the government out of the lives of We the People and empower individuals to make the best decisions to meet their personal situations.

Thank you for taking the time to join me tonight and please continue to send your questions. I look forward to meeting more of you on the campaign trail in the days to come.",2016-02-17 02:30:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_596219140544556",NA,5009,283,1240,NA,NA,NA

"407","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello, Friends. It’s been a great couple of days on the campaign trail in South Carolina and it’s been an honor to have the opportunity to present my solutions to the important issues facing our nation. Keep texting your thoughts and questions to 275-236 (ASKBEN).

Tonight, I wanted to take some time to talk about veterans issues in our country and what we as a nation can do to better care for our brave service men and women.

Our veterans are heroes that deserve the greatest degree of care available and we must ensure that we are fostering seamless transitions from their time of service into their time as civilians. The recent and ongoing failures of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are a national disgrace. The VA’s fundamental problems are twofold: first, the Secretary of the VA does not have the authority he needs to manage the organization and second, the culture at the VA needs to change. 

My comprehensive plan to reform the Department of  Veterans Affairs will begin with ensuring that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the necessary authority that they need to execute the job that they have been given. We need to standardize our acquisition procedures across the board in order to decrease the overhead costs of running the department while also modernizing the process to meet the needs of the 21st century. Finally, above all else, we must encourage a system of accountability that ensures that our government fulfills their obligation to take care of our heroes.

As a nation, we made a promise to those who bear the burden and scars of service in our armed forces that we would attend to their medical care. That is a promise we must keep, and in a Carson administration, it is one we will keep and keep well. 

Tomorrow is the South Carolina Primary, and if you place your trust in me, I will be a candidate of integrity and honor that will follow through on the promises that I have made. I hope that I can count on your vote.",2016-02-20 02:30:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_597511560415314",NA,5916,359,1149,NA,NA,NA

Dr. Carson is humbled by the support and donations from hundreds of thousands across the country who look to him as their voice for change in a system that has left “We the People” behind. His consistent message of faith, integrity and common sense solutions has resonated with the people; he continues to be viewed more favorably than any other candidate and routinely polls as the most honest and sincere person in the race. And a poll out today confirmed he would beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head race.

""Thank you to my many supporters and volunteers in South Carolina and around the country,” said Dr. Carson. “While professional politicians have long written off our efforts to return the government to the people, we remain undaunted. We’ve barely finished the first inning, and there’s a lot of game left. I look forward to carrying on to the Nevada caucuses, sharing my message to “Heal, Inspire, and Revive” this great nation. As more Americans have their say, they will see the true strength of our movement.""

"431","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello, Friends. It’s been another great day on the campaign trail in Nevada, and I wanted to take some time to address your questions and the important issues facing our nation. As always, please text your thoughts and questions to ASK BEN (253-236).

I want to take some time to talk about an important issue that is not only affecting our current economy, but it will also have an adverse impact on generations to come. Our federal government has run amuck with out-of-control spending and bloated programs that do not serve the best interest of We the People. Currently, our nation is $19 trillion in debt, which means that every American infant that comes into the world is already burdened with $58,000 of debt.  I have come up with a real solution to reign in our unmanageable spending and promote viable practices to ensure our nation’s fiscal security.

In order to stop the bleeding and take control of our spending habits, we must streamline the federal government, reduce inefficiencies, take a serious look at reforming health care and entitlement programs, generate revenue by divesting federal assets, and pursue adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 

Our federal government is bloated with inconceivable amounts of unnecessary spending that is simply waste that we must eliminate. The GAO has already identified numerous programs and agencies that serve similar or identical functions that could immediately be downsized or eliminated altogether. By implementing the GOA’s recommendations alone, we could eliminate up to $650 billion worth of wasteful spending every year. Additionally, we can eliminate up to $5.5 trillion worst of spending over the next decade by repealing Obamacare, corporate welfare, reducing interference in the energy sector, and privatizing companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

It’s not enough for us to reduce spending in our existing programs, without looking at the very essence of some of our major programs and coming with ways to fundamentally reshape them in order to reduce waste. The three major entitlement programs that must be examined are Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. One meaningful step that we can take is to gradually increase the age of retirement and benefit receipt to more accurately represent longevity. Additionally, we need to modernize Medicare and Medicaid to more aptly meet the needs of a population that is living longer with increasingly specialized medical concerns.

One additional step that we can take to reduce spending and increase revenue is to begin selling unnecessary federal assets. Currently, the United States government owns 640 million acres of land and over 300,000 buildings. The government’s retention of such enormous amounts of land and property costs the taxpayers millions of dollars to upkeep and that could alternatively be sold to the private sector. Selling off even a portion of these resources could lead to $2 trillion to $4 trillion worth of revenue over the next decade.

My dream is to create an America for our children that is better than the America that we grew up in, but unfortunately this is an impossibility with our government’s current wasteful tendencies. I hope that you will join me in my fight to take back control of our government for We the People and ensure a better tomorrow for everyone to enjoy. I am looking forward to the Nevada Caucus tomorrow; where I hope the people of The Silver State will consider giving me their vote. Thank you. - Ben",2016-02-23 02:30:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_599104133589390",NA,7469,629,1675,NA,NA,NA

"459","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","At tonight’s CNN Republican presidential debate in Houston, Texas, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, again shared his vision – and displayed his determination – for building a better America.

In a debate characterized by personal attacks and hostile rhetoric, Dr. Carson called for candidates to tackle the nation’s problems of divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility and failure of leadership – not by destroying each other – but by focusing on serving the American people. Demonstrating strength and clarity, Dr. Carson expressed his frustrations with the Internal Revenue Service, stood strongly for America’s alliance with Israel and outlined his strategy for thwarting the North Korean nuclear threat.

In this race, Dr. Carson has offered common-sense solutions to America’s domestic and foreign challenges and has issued more detailed policy proposals than any of his opponents. He continues to appeal to the best of the American people and believes that eventually they will be more interested in a presidential candidate’s policies and solutions than in his personality. Even more important, not once in this campaign has Dr. Carson compromised his values and principles for political expediency. That is exactly how he will serve in the Oval Office.

In the past week, many in the political and media establishment have said that Dr. Carson has no path forward in the 2016 presidential race. At tonight’s debate, Dr. Carson once again proved that talking heads and Beltway insiders do not understand him, and never have. 

Dr. Carson has fought – and continues to fight – for those who have been ignored for far too long by Washington. He has built a movement of Americans from every part of the country and every walk of life, including many who had never before participated in the political process, as well as many others who had given up on the country’s political leadership.

Unlike the mainstream media and the political establishment, the American people continue to express faith in Dr. Carson’s candidacy. Just in the past 24 hours, the Carson for President 2016 Campaign has raised record funds from an email to existing grassroots supporters. 

With less than 5 percent of the delegates selected, this presidential race has just begun. The field has narrowed to five candidates, and tonight’s debate only sharpened the contrast between the other candidates’ promises and Dr. Carson’s vision and values.

"488","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","Hello, Friends. It’s been another great day on the campaign trail in Kentucky, Virginia, and Alabama and I feel incredibly blessed to have the support of so many people. It’s been great to connect with supports from all walks of life who believe that our country is headed in the wrong direction and that I am the best candidate to effect real change. I wanted to take a few moments tonight before tomorrow’s primaries to answer some of your questions. Keep texting your thoughts and questions to ASK BEN (275-236).

Our first question tonight come from Sara in Texas who wants to know, very simply, why I am continuing to run for President of the United States.

Thanks for the question, Sara. I am continuing to run for President because I believe that our country is standing at a crossroad. We are on the brink of the fiscal abyss, the world no longer respects us as a global power, and our own borders are incredibly insecure - making our nation very susceptible to criminal and terrorist threats. I believe that it is not too late to change course and that the right leader can steer our nation to safer shores. As President, I would be a fierce defender of the Constitution, I would revitalize our military so that they are equipped to quickly degeat our enemies abroad and protect our people at home, and I will be a President that will fight every day to limit the reach of the government and empower We the People.

Our second question tonight comes from Blake in Minnesota who wants to know what my thoughts are about Super Tuesday tomorrow.

Blake, tomorrow is an important day in our nation’s election process and it cannot be overstated that more delegates will be allotted tomorrow than on any other day in this primary process. It is my hope that the American people will consider the substance of my policies and my life’s experiences as a leader when they go to vote, and that they will not simply be distracted by the loudest voices in the room. I am determined to provide a better future for our next generation and I believe that I have presented a clear and comprehensive plan to accomplish that goal. You can read all of my positions by visiting www.bencarson.com/issues. If you believe in what I am trying to accomplish, please bring your friends and family with you when you go to the polls tomorrow and encourage everyone that you know to send a champion of the people to DC.

Our final question tonight comes from Alex who is a college student that wants to know why he, as young person, should consider voting for me.

That’s a great question Alex. It is important to recognize that the idea of “free college” is a fantasy that is being peddled by liberal progressives as though it is as simple as wishing it in to existence. This is simply not the case. In reality, student loans have been monopolized by the federal government and have led to large amounts of student debt and artificially high interest rates. This is the real legacy of the Left’s education policy. My education plan focusses on privatizing the student loan industry so that prices are naturally kept low through the free markey. We can’t simply give away free tuition to everyone, but we can make college more affordable for those who are willing to work hard and put in the effort.

Thank you for joining me this evening and if you are a resident of a Super Tuesday state, I would be honored if you would consider voting for a me tomorrow. I am a common sense candidate committed to protecting the rights of the American people and not serving the political elite. If you are a resident of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, or Virginia, please remember that you have an open primary which means that you can vote in either primary race regardless of party affiliation. I am interested in representing all of the American people and welcome the support of anyone who believes that our country is in desperate need of healing and that it will take real plans, like the ones that I have presented, to save our nation.",2016-03-01 02:32:00,"status",NA,"138691142964027_602341289932341",NA,12879,955,2921,NA,NA,NA

“I am not moved or discouraged when the political class count me out,” said Dr. Carson. “When I began my campaign more than a year ago, there were 17 viable candidates seeking the GOP nomination. Today, because “We the People” continue to show unprecedented support, I remain one of five. Millions of Americans plead with me to continue.  They want to have a choice and a representative voice to ensure people of faith are not marginalized and that integrity is restored to leadership, with a focus on common sense solutions to the myriad problems we face as a nation. They know I am a citizen candidate, not a politician, who won’t do what is expedient, but what is right.""

"504","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","I have lived a blessed life and achieved more success than I ever dreamed was possible. Running for President was never on my bucket list, and when I was drafted by a grassroots movement asking me to do so, it was not a decision that I made lightly and saw as an act of service. 

However, I believed that my values, life experience and common sense solutions put me in a position to help get our nation back on track for the sake of our children and grandchildren. This grueling endeavor would not have been worth it for any other reason.

When I began exploring a run for President as a private citizen detached from the political class, I had neither a political team nor a national network of wealthy donors standing by waiting to support me.

We had to build a grassroots campaign from scratch by reaching out to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible and through every means possible, resulting in indisputable success. This movement consistently outraised the entire Republican field, got onto every ballot and built a 50-state, bricks-and-mortar campaign infrastructure to share my story, values and solutions. It was an historic feat, and I’ll be forever grateful to my team and my incredible supporters, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America, on behalf of the best interests of the American people.

I hope my presence added a measure of civility to the race, raised issues that would not otherwise have been discussed and had an overall positive impact. While our political efforts must come to a close, gratefully, the grassroots movement that has given new voice to “We the People” and inspired millions will continue. 

I may be departing the campaign trail, but I will not be departing the scene.  Instead, for the rest of my life, I will continue to work tirelessly to do everything I can to save America for the next generation. 

I will be working on a number of initiatives, including serving as honorary chair of My Faith Votes, a non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing the 25 million Evangelicals who didn't vote in the last election. The twin pillars of faith and family are under attack, and I will endeavor to strengthen our nation by preserving them both.

I have committed to not endorse a specific individual, but rather “We the People.” Though many today are making decisions based on fear and anger, I trust their judgment to logically examine the candidates and make the right decision by looking at:

(1) Whether they have demonstrated significant accomplishments over their lives and careers.

(2) If they have ideas that are clear and policies that are easy to find.

(3) How they treat their family and others, as that is how they will lead the country.

(4) What they have done to improve the lives of Americans;
the people they are with, what they are saying and how they collaborate with others.

(5) Their ethics, because what America needs is “Trickle-down ethics.

Conservatives should not be embarrassed by capitalism, but must couple it with compassion, to lift people out of a culture of dependency and provide ladders of opportunity for all Americans to be a part of the fabric of society.

People need to understand this is a most important election, in which we are deciding whether we allow the government to dictate our rights and take care of our needs, or whether individuals will rise up and take responsibility in an atmosphere of opportunity for all.

The bottom line is, “We the People” are the ones making the decisions; but in order to do that, we must become active and informed, not manipulated by the political classes and media.

Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to saving America for future generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation. 

Equally important, we need to understand that Republicans are not each others' enemies. We need to engage in conversation and challenge each others' positions, not fight each other. Conservatives need to unify together so that that we do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and put another secular progressive in the White House.",2016-03-05 02:51:37,"status",NA,"138691142964027_604162299750240",NA,286155,32936,78595,NA,NA,NA

We can make changes to our system and that change starts now with, “We the People.” 

We can have disagreements, but it is critical that we not allow those disagreements to divide us as a party or as a country. 

It is with that in mind that I endorse Donald Trump for President. I have known Donald for many years. He is a successful businessman who has built a recognizable global brand that no one can question. His experience as a businessman is exactly what we need to move our economic engine in the right direction and empower those who have been left out of the American dream for far too long.

With our support, I am sure that we can help restore America's values and faith.

"512","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","General Bob Dees, Campaign Chairman, Carson for President 2016 on Dr. Carson's endorsement of Donald Trump:

Team Carson,

You are no doubt aware of Dr. Carson’s official endorsement of Donald Trump at a press conference today, the rationale for which he reiterated on his Facebook page this morning.

Subsequently, many of you sent strong messages of support for today’s endorsement, while many others sent equally strong messages of disappointment. In all candor, some of this critical dynamic reminds me of Passion Week which began with Hosannas from the people, and ended with “Crucify Him.” Yet Christ had not changed, just as Dr. Ben Carson has not changed his devotion to God, his fundamental policy convictions regarding the right path for our nation, or his undying commitment to Save America for Future Generations.

For those of you who seek to analyze this decision through a spiritual lens, we must ask how God’s purposes might have been thwarted if Daniel had not served in Babylon, or if Joseph had not served Pharaoh?  In a similar vein, Dr. Carson’s endorsement is not driven by political ambition or any “sell out” on Dr. Carson’s part -- rather Dr. Carson remains the same wise, practical, empirically-driven, and God-honoring leader and selfless servant he has always been.

While each of us is ultimately responsible to God and others for our response, I would ask those who have been so quick to judge and condemn to simply think about it further.  The thoughts below reflect Dr. Carson’s thinking on the challenges we face. 

Let us reason together for a moment:
·       Our nation cannot survive another secular progressive administration, particularly under the leadership of someone like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.  If the Democrats win this next election, America as we know it will cease to exist.

·      Dr. Carson is an empirical thinker, assessing realities and determining common sense solutions to achieve the desired goal. The reality is that Donald Trump, along with the talented team which he will no doubt assemble, is the Republican Party’s best opportunity to win back the White House.  Instead of Republican Party operatives falling on their sword regarding “anyone but Trump,” they should embrace the millions of newly interested Republicans, channeling their passion (and anger) into positive change and a likely victory. They should let the democratic process work.

·      A majority of Dr. Carson supporters have consistently identified Donald Trump as their fallback choice, another outsider who can truly break the political paradigm of corruption and cronyism in Washington.  As we have said for many months now, “Donald Trump and Ben Carson sing from the same song book; they just sing in different keys.”

·      Our strength is our unity.  In Dr. Carson’s sentiments from this morning, we cannot allow agents of division and political operatives to pit us against one another, or to thwart the voice of the people.  Donald Trump possesses the capability to unite Americans and represent all of “We The People” in ways that his leading opponents simply cannot do.  As Dr. Carson highlighted this morning, Donald Trump possesses the intellect, introspection (a surprise to many who do not truly know him), adaptive leadership, and boldness needed to truly break the Washington DC political paradigm that holds America captive. 

·       As always, Dr. Carson is not being politically correct -- he simply wants to save America.  He simply wants to solve the great challenges we face.  This is why he has courageously and boldly endorsed Donald Trump as the best way to help “We The People.” The man who we have loved and followed has not changed – he continues to walk in faith as his Lord provides wisdom and a “lamp unto his path.”

As always, my comments simply cannot do justice to the true depth or significance of Dr. Carson’s thoughts.  I commend Dr. Carson’s full comments at this morning’s press announcement. I have never heard him to be more clear, convicted, or compelling.  He remains laser focused, always seeking to do the right thing for the right reasons.

While some of you may still disagree with Dr. Carson’s endorsement decision, may the “banner of love” characterize our thoughts and actions.  May each of us avoid the politics of personal destruction and divisive rhetoric that besets our land.  May each of us be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.  May each of us seek to Save America for Future Generations.  Ultimately, may God heal our land, as He inspires and revives “We The People.”

Prayerfully and respectfully to all,

"729","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","The political establishment and their paid political consultants continue to attempt to play politics as usual. I recently chose to endorse Eric Greitens, a conservative republican running for Governor of Missouri. In the face of countless attacks from the Obama political team and the Democratic Governors Association, Eric has persevered and maintained above the fray.

Like many, Eric was born and raised a Democrat, but the experience of serving four tours in the Global War on Terrorism, opening and running his own business, and watching government bureaucracy destroy the lives of veterans, Eric made the choice to become a conservative. Realizing, like so many that his convictions did not align with those of the Democratic Party.  

He is a God-fearing family man who has served our country with great honor. And unlike many in Washington, Eric has dedicated his time to working with Republicans and Democrats to support our veterans because he understands that we are stronger when we work together. He is pro-life and believes that life begins at conception. 

Eric worked with orphaned children in Bosnia, with Rwandan children and families who survived the genocide, with children of the street in Bolivia, with orphans in Albania, and in one of Mother Teresa's Homes for the Destitute and Dying in Varanasi, India. He saw the power of true love and compassion, and the power of that comes with a commitment to treat every life with dignity. 

If elected as Governor of Missouri, he will advance these conservative principles. The voters of Missouri must not be swayed by those on the left or right seeking to impose their views on the people. ‘We the People’ are tired of politics as usual, and Eric Greitens is a solid Christian Conservative who has put his life on the line as a member of our armed services and seeks to continue selfless service by becoming the next Governor of Missouri.

"784","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","We have a clear choice this November and that choice isn't Hillary Clinton. She has proven time and time again why she shouldn't be president. From her emails to her pay-to-play scheme during her tenure as Secretary of State, is this really someone we want in the White House? 

We’re at a turning point in our country and if a progressive is elected president and appoints 2 to 4 supreme court justices, America as we know it will be fundamentally changed. 

This is why I'm working hard every day to educate Americans on the importance of the Supreme Court with Fight for the Court. Soon, I will be hosting a series of telephone town halls and release a series of educational videos on the importance of the supreme court in this election. 

This initiative is important because it’s critical that we reach and educate as many people as possible on this significance of the supreme court during this election, what it means, and how it could impact all of us.

"840","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","In a very telling moment, Hillary Clinton maligned me and millions of other Americans as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic and Islamophobic ""deplorables."" 

I'm so tired of this line of attack that normally taunts conservatives. Well let me be very specific in my response. I believe in expanding opportunity, not welfare; that's not racist. 

I believe every life is worth protecting, particularly the unborn; that doesn't make me sexist. 

I believe marriage is between one man and one woman; that's not homophobic. 

I believe in borders, the rule of law and our sovereign right to decide who to let into our country; that's not xenophobic. 

I believe radical Islam is a mortal threat to America and Western civilization; that is common sense, not Islamophobia.

My nationwide ‘Fight for the Court’ project is about explaining and protecting our Constitutional values. As you can see, they're under constant assault, and if we allow the Left to institutionalize their vision of a European-style, government-dominated, secular society through our courts, we are going to lose our country for a generation.

If you're tired of being vilified for believing in the Constitutional, Judeo-Christian values that made America great, please help me send a message by signing up to join me now.

We must use moments like this as opportunities because this is not just name-calling. The Left is using every tool at their disposal to whitewash our history and undercut our institutions. 

The difference is that I believe in our nation as it was founded. I believe in ""We the People,"" but it requires us to constantly reach out, inform, and mobilize conservatives.

There are a lot of challenges before us and a lot of problems to solve. I've decided to concentrate on a few. ‘Fight for the Court’ is about protecting our Constitutional values. 

Elections every few years are our opportunity to correct course if necessary, but the Supreme Court can be lost for a generation or more. 

I ask you to join me by signing up and helping us to continue this fight.

Thank you for your commitment.",2016-09-13 17:49:51,"link","https://www.fightforthecourt.org/?sc=dbcfb","138691142964027_697326633767139",NA,110937,5581,46470,"fightforthecourt.org",NA,NA

"868","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","The death of Keith Scott in North Carolina has created a lot of emotions. There are strong opinions on both sides, but it is important that all sides remain calm.

Opinions are understandably strong and everyone has a right to air their frustration, but we must not allow that to cause us to act violently because that only diminishes the pain felt by so many.

There are some who are purposely causing strife and we must not allow those few to dictate the perception of the many who are peacefully protesting.

For those of us who don't understand why so many are upset, we must imagine how we ourselves would feel in a like situation. Perhaps after such self-reflection, we can all reach a place that provides clarity for us all. The suffering of some, should cause all of us to stop and ponder the state of things in our country. 

We are better when we are together and we must take the time to understand each other. It is critically important that we not allow our differences to divide us because it is those differences that makes us all irreplaceable.",2016-09-23 11:57:21,"status",NA,"138691142964027_702499963249806",NA,17044,763,3384,NA,NA,NA

"880","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","I reside in the 18th Congressional district of Florida where Brian Mast, an injured combat veteran, is running for Congress. When I said that this grassroots movement on behalf of 'We the People' will continue, I was thinking of candidates like Brian Mast. Brian is a soldier who put service and sacrifice for his country ahead of himself and his personal needs. He is not a career politician, but a man of the people, fighting for the people. His dedication to our national security and his unique point of view as a U.S Service Member in Afghanistan will bring fresh, common sense solutions to Washington D.C. I am proud to say Brian Mast has my endorsement and will have my vote in November.

"907","138691142964027","Dr. Ben & Candy Carson","The recent disclosure of lewd conversations Donald Trump had over a decade ago has caused some disillusionment among GOP stalwarts and conservative voters. In no way do I condone Trumps behavior - in fact I condemn any form of disrespect towards women. We should always honor and respect the dignity of our mothers, sisters and daughters. Even though the incident happened ten years ago, well before Trump entered the political arena, this behavior is unacceptable, especially by someone who aspires to higher office. Trump did the right thing in immediately and unequivocally apologizing.

 I feel fairly certain that the progressives have had knowledge of this conversation for a long time and dropped it at this point in time in an effort too obscure the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton and her desire for open borders. I believe that they have more material that they will release periodically up until the election to keep a negative focus on Donald Trump. They do not want to discuss the vital issues that are destroying our nation and the future of our children, because they do not have logical solutions and offer more of the same that has gotten us into this precarious situation.

Those of us who do not want to see America fundamentally devolve into something worse must be wise enough to recognize the scheme that is being played out here. We must demand not only that the issues be discussed but also that we make our decisions based on issues and not on personalities or decade old statements and behavior by Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The political elites and their loyal media are desperate because they are seeing the large enthusiastic crowds for Donald Trump and the meager crowds for Hillary Clinton, and they know that there will be a huge enthusiasm gap on election day. 

The question is; will the political elites of both parties succeed in continuing there reign of fiscal irresponsibility and military weakness or will the people understand what is going on and will they be wise enough to thwart those efforts?",2016-10-08 18:03:51,"status",NA,"138691142964027_710730435760092",NA,158989,14720,98097,NA,NA,NA

There is no reversal of my position in terms of working with the Trump administration. I have always made it clear that I preferred to work outside of the government as an advisor, but if called upon, I would serve inside of the government. I believe it is important to have voices that are outside of the administration combating media bias and The divisiveness that has infected our country.

First of all it will be necessary to assure people that there is no desire to pull the rug out from underneath anyone who is already getting insurance. The desire is to create a system that is centered around patient and healthcare providers and not around insurance and government bureaucrats.
